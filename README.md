# Welcome to Bug Wrangler Ranch

This first self-assessment is for you to hone several Core Skills that you need as a software developer.

Taking your time now to be thorough, reflective, patient and curious will give you the foundation to be successful throughout the rest of this course and your career.

If you rush this, or think of it as a test to be "passed", then you will already be on the wrong path.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Description

Slim Jenkins offers a vacation package for people who have always wanted to join a cattle driving team across the American Midwest.

He calls it the **Kansas Slim's Cattle Adventure**.

People join a team of experienced drovers who will train them in the basics of herding cattle and driving them across hundreds of miles to their destination at Old Red's Ranch.

Unfortunately, someone gained access to the code that produces an outline of the adventure to the paying customers, so Slim has hired you to examine and fix the code.

## Learning Objectives

Here are your learning objectives for this self-assessment.

1. Able to use the debugger to step through existing code to discover root causes of bugs.
2. Drawing a sequence diagram for a project.
   > Use the [sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/) site to generate your sequence diagram. Make sure you save your work as you go.
3. Demonstrate learning efficiency by researching concepts you haven't seen before using your peers, mentors, and the World Wide Web as resources.
4. Awareness of when you need help, and then seeking it out.

## Example Output

If you are able to fix all of the bugs, you will output similar to what is below. It will not be identical, but similar.

You will be accompanying 5 drovers as they drive 50 cattle to Old Red's Ranch for grazing

The herd is made of up the following types of cattle:
Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Brown Swiss,
Ankina,American Angus,Ankina,Brown Swiss,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,
Brown Swiss,American Angus,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,

Here is the team of drovers you will be joining
        * Melvyn Hethron
        * Yancy Gresley
        * Willabella Attarge
        * Ynes Gyenes
        * Farlie Spere


Your journey will take you through the wildness of the American Midwest and across the following terrain
        * forest
        * plain
        * river
        * mountain
```

1. In the **main** module, one of the first lines of code is `const drovers = hireDrovers(cattleToDrive)`. Explain what the value of the `drovers` variable is when that line of code runs.
   > The variable drovers is a constant, meaning what it has been assigned as cannot change. It has been assigned the value of the function hireDrovers, when the argument cattleToDrive has been passed through it. I can see that the value of cattleToDrive has been declared as 50 in the variable const cattleToDrive = 50. The hireDrovers function will invoke the variable cattleToDrive and set this to be divided by 10, which means the value of drovers will be 5. This value of 5 will then be assigned to the constant variable numberNeeded. This value will not change because all variables being invoked are constant.
2. At the bottom of the main module, you will see the following code - `for (const drover of drovers)`. Explain what the values of both the `drover` and the `drovers` variables are.
   > `for (const drover of drovers)` is a for...of loop. drovers is an array that is being iterated over, while drover is being declared as a constant variable. for every iteration through the objects within drovers, drover will be assigned an element (in this case it will be the first name and last name)
3. In the **journey** module, there is a `journeyMaker()` function. In that function, there is a variable named `areas` which will have the value of an object. Use your debugger to show what the value of each key is on that object. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com) to record your session.
   > (https://www.loom.com/share/7165622158b045ac8ae1210f2dabc7c1)
4. Also in the **journey** module, there is the following code:
   ```js
   for (let forestNumber = 0; forestNumber < areas.forests; forestNumber++) {
      journey.push("forest")
   }
   ```
   Explain this code with your best vocabulary.
   > This is a for loop with forestNumber = 0 as the initialization, should be noted that this variable has been declared using let so this can be adjusted elsewhere in the code. following the initialization is the condition forestNumber < areas.forests, this for loop will continue as long as the condition is true. Finally forestNumber++ is the iteration, the ++ will increment forestNumber by 1 every time this loops. this for loop is a function with one statement  journey.push("forest"). This statement will push the element forest to the end of the Journey array.
5. Explain the value of the `database` variable in the **database** module. Be as comprehensive as possible.
   > Database is a constant variable (it cannot be changed within the code). Witin the function there are two different arrays. I believe the arrays are set within a function so the local scope does not intertwine with the global scope (names of objects,elements etc)? The first array is a set of Objects called cattleTypes and within these objects there are two elements.The second array is a set of objects called drovers and within these objects there are 4 elements.
6. In the **drovers** module, there is a `hireDrovers()` function. You will notice the following code on that line - `(herdSize)`. What is that defining, and where does it get its value?
   > The herdSize is the parameter in this function, but I dont think its value has been defined anywhere in the code?

## When You Are Done

After you have answered all the questions above, you need to push all of your code back up to Github. Follow these instructions.

1. Be in the `bug-wrangler-ranch` directory.
2. `git add --all`
3. `git commit -m "Code complete"`
4. `git push origin main`

Then go to the Learning Platform and click the **Self-assessment Complete** button.
